\chapter*{Introduction}

Reversible computing is an area of computer science concerned with the ability to perform computations in reverse.
This is useful in a number of applications, such as debugging, and quantum computing.
Currently, the availability of real world tools such as compilers and interpreters are sparse and limited to few languages.
This project aims to implement a complete compiler for the reversible programming language RIMP\@.
