\chapter*{Introduction}

Reversible computing is an area of computer science concerned with the ability to perform computations in reverse\cite{IntroductionToReversibleComputingBook, LogicalReversibility, richardpFeynmanLecturesComputation2018}.
This is useful in a number of applications, such as debugging, and quantum computing\cite{richardpFeynmanLecturesComputation2018, debug, ReversiblePrologDebugger}.
Currently, the availability of real world tools such as compilers and interpreters are sparse and limited to few languages.
This project aims to implement a complete compiler for the reversible programming language RIMP\cite{RIMP}.
