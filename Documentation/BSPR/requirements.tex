\chapter*{Requirements}

An overview of functional requirements, perhaps non-functional requirements, and a brief description of use cases.

Note, From a example submission:
Ullah Joya
Loyalty Card App
2015

"Importance of the requirements is shown next to them. A high priority requirement
must be implemented for the project to be considered complete. Without low
priority requirements, useful but not critical, the application should offer basic
23
functionality. High priority requirements should be implemented first and then
tackle other lower priority requirements."

So we should be able to specify even aspirational requirements, and then prioritise them.
