% Give a proof that my implementation of regular expressions is correct.
% We may also convert it to an isabelle/HOL proof.
% Hopefully we will be able to provide something like this for all major components of the project.
% Or at least the ones which are reasonable and most likely to introduce issues.

Given the definition of languages and regular expressions, we can prove that the implementation given is correct.
The implementation is a modified version of Brzozowski's\cite{brzozowski} algorithm for matching regular expressions.
We will use the notion of a language $l$ being $nullable_l$ to mean that the language contains the empty string $\epsilon$.
$nullable_l(l) = \epsilon \in l$
We will also use a function $derivative_l$ which takes a language, and a character, and returns the derivative of the language with respect to the character.
$derivative_l(l, c) = \{s | c::s \in l\}$

We can now define these functions for regular expressions.
