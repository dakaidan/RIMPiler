Reversible computing\cite{IntroductionToReversibleComputing} is a key area of research, providing wide spanning benefits, from low-power computing\cite{landauerIrreversibility}, to greater debugging features\cite{PrologDebugger} within programming languages. Several languages have been proposed, such as Janus\cite{Janus} which ensures reversibility by strict rules on how the program can be written. Unlike Janus, \rimplang provides a high-level interface to write programs, which can then be transformed into a reversible program.
This thesis presents a framework for the development of reversible languages, focusing primarily on the imperative language \rimplang. Building upon prior work by Fern√°ndez et al.\cite{Rimp}, we introduce a new syntax for \rimplang and extend its capabilities to support types. We provide implementations in Rust, including an evaluator, an abstract machine, and a compiler targeting the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Our implementation also allows for the easy expansion of the features of \rimplang, allowing the language to grow, and become more expressive in the future.
