Filling this gap, Introduction to Reversible Computing offers an expanded view of the field that includes the traditional energy-motivated hardware viewpoint as well as the emerging application-motivated software approach.   Collecting scattered knowledge into one coherent account, the book provides a compendium of both classical and recently developed results on reversible computing. It explores up-and-coming theories, techniques, and tools for the application of reversible computing{\textemdash}the logical next step in the evolution of computing systems.  The book covers theory, hardware and software aspects, fundamental limits, complexity analyses, practical algorithms, compilers, efficiency improvement techniques, and application areas. The topics span several areas of computer science, including high-performance computing, parallel/distributed systems, computational theory, compilers, power-aware computing, and supercomputing.   The book presents sufficient material for newcomers to easily get started. It provides citations to original articles on seminal results so that readers can consult the corresponding publications in the literature. Pointers to additional resources are included for more advanced topics. For those already familiar with a certain topic within reversible computing, the book can serve as a one-stop reference to other topics in the field.},

We give algorithms for deciding if a given grammar satisfies the LR(k) condition, for given k, and also give methods for generating recognizes for LR(k) grammars. It is shown that the problem of whether or not a grammar is LR(k) for some k is undecidable, and the paper concludes by establishing various connections between LR(k) grammars and deterministic languages. In particular, the LR(k) condition is a natural analogue, for grammars, of the deterministic condition, for languages.},

Here it is shown that such machines may be made logically reversible at every step, while retaining their simplicity and their ability to do general computations. This result is of great physical interest because it makes plausible the existence of thermodynamically reversible computers which could perform useful computations at useful speed while dissipating considerably less than kT of energy per logical step. In the first stage of its computation the logically reversible automaton parallels the corresponding irreversible automaton, except that it saves all intermediate results, thereby avoiding the irreversible operation of erasure. The second stage consists of printing out the desired output. The third stage then reversibly disposes of all the undesired intermediate results by retracing the steps of the first stage in backward order (a process which is only possible because the first stage has been carried out reversibly), thereby restoring the machine (except for the now-written output tape) to its original condition. The final machine configuration thus contains the desired output and a reconstructed copy of the input, but no other undesired data. The foregoing results are demonstrated explicitly using a type of three-tape Turing machine. The biosynthesis of messenger RNA is discussed as a physical example of reversible computation.},

One of the important questions is the existence of reversible programs with minimal extra output (garbage data). To answer this question for programs that implement partial functions over countable domains, we introduce an order on infinite garbage sets and a notion of minimality. To this end, we present two methods for functions specified by decidable and semi-decidable predicates. Both methods are universal, which means they work for all programs specified by the predicates. They cover Bennett's classic input-erasing reversible computation of injective functions. Hence, any program written in a Turing-complete programming language can be implemented with g-minimal garbage in an r-Turing-complete reversible programming language. This generality comes at the cost of a considerable runtime due to the generate-and-test approach.},

In this paper, we build a metalanguage foundation for reversible languages from categorical principles, based on the category of sets and partial injective functions. We exemplify our approach by a step-by-step development of the full semantics of an r-Turing complete reversible while-language with recursive procedures. The use of the metalanguage leads to a formalization of the reversible semantics. A language defined in the metalanguage is guaranteed to have reversibility and inverse semantics. Also, program inverters for this language are obtained for free. We further discuss applications and directions for reversible semantics.},

  abstract = {rfun is a small first-order reversible functional language introduced by Yokoyama et al. in 2012. The present paper aims to further the understanding of reversible functional programming (and RFUN in particular) by describing implementations in, and of, the RFUN language. After briefly summarizing rfun in terms of syntax and semantics, we first (informally) describe a transformation from the simple irreversible first-order language fun to rfun. This highlights how irreversibility is avoided in rfun, such as in the use of the so-called first-match policy. It also emphasizes the fact that rfun is trace-less, while also showing how the standard reversible (trace-full) embeddings of Landauer and Bennett can be implemented. Second, we outline (by examples) a number of the reversible functions that have been implemented in rfun. The programming examples given here focus on Peano arithmetic and list functions, and are intended to show various useful programming techniques of the reversible functional programming paradigm. Finally, we discuss the implementation of rfun. This is twofold as we relate a Haskell implementation of an rfun interpreter, to an implementation of a self-interpreter, i.e., an rfun interpreter implemented in rfun. Although rfun does not have the rich and expressive syntax of Haskell---which makes programming the self-interpreter more cumbersome in some aspects---the built-in support for reverse execution greatly reduces the code base and makes the rfun-based self-interpreter implementation follow the formal semantics of rfun more directly than the Haskell-based interpreter.},

  abstract = {Imperative programming languages are not reversible in general; however, there are well-known approaches to make them reversible, e.g., by storing computation histories or checkpointing. Another successful approach is based on designing restricted languages where all the commands are reversible (cf. Janus, R-WHILE). We present an alternative approach where we do not restrict the language. Instead, we modify the operational semantics (while preserving the meaning of programs) to obtain reversibility at both language level and computation level.},

  abstract = {High-level reversible programming languages are few and far between and in general offer only rudimentary abstractions from the details of the underlying machine. Modern programming languages offer a wide array of language constructs and paradigms to facilitate the design of abstract interfaces, but we currently have a very limited understanding of the applicability of such features for reversible programming languages. We introduce the first reversible object-oriented programming language, ROOPL, with support for user-defined data types, class inheritance and subtype-polymorphism. The language extends the design of existing reversible imperative languages and it allows for effective implementation on reversible machines. We provide a formalization of the language semantics, the type system and we demonstrate the computational universality of the language by implementing a reversible Turing machine simulator. ROOPL statements are locally invertible at no extra cost to program size or computational complexity and the language provides direct access to the inverse semantics of each class method. We describe the techniques required for a garbage-free translation from ROOPL to the reversible assembly language PISA and provide a full implementation of said techniques. Our results indicate that core language features for object-oriented programming carries over to the field of reversible computing in some capacity.},

  abstract = {The Static Single Assignment (SSA) form is a program representation used in many optimizing compilers. The key step in converting a program to SSA form is called {$\phi$}-placement. Many algorithms for {$\phi$}-placement have been proposed in the literature, but the relationships between these algorithms are not well understood.In this article, we propose a framework within which we systematically derive (i) properties of the SSA form and (ii) {$\phi$}-placement algorithms. This framework is based on a new relation called merge which captures succinctly the structure of a program's control flow graph that is relevant to its SSA form. The {$\phi$}-placement algorithms we derive include most of the ones described in the literature, as well as several new ones. We also evaluate experimentally the performance of some of these algorithms on the SPEC92 benchmarks.Some of the algorithms described here are optimal for a single variable. However, their repeated application is not necessarily optimal for multiple variables. We conclude the article by describing such an optimal algorithm, based on the transitive reduction of the merge relation, for multi-variable {$\phi$}-placement in structured programs. The problem for general programs remains open.},

In spite of its simplicity, the runtime of our algorithm is on par with Cytron et al.'s algorithm.},

We argue that extended regular expressions combined with the ability to extract submatch information significantly increase the expressiveness of lexer specifications.

The approach has been implemented in an ML lexer tool which is compatible with ocamllex. Experimental results confirm that our approach is competitive with respect to existing ML lexer tools.},

  abstract = {It is argued that computing machines inevitably involve devices which perform logical functions that do not have a single-valued inverse. This logical irreversibility is associated with physical irreversibility and requires a minimal heat generation, per machine cycle, typically of the order of kT for each irreversible function. This dissipation serves the purpose of standardizing signals and making them independent of their exact logical history. Two simple, but representative, models of bistable devices are subjected to a more detailed analysis of switching kinetics to yield the relationship between speed and energy dissipation, and to estimate the effects of errors induced by thermal fluctuations.},
