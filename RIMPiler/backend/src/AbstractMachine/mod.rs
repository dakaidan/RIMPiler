/* Abstract Machine Specification

   Components:
       - Control Stack
       - Result Stack
       - Arithmetic Unit
       - Memory store
       - Back stack

   At the reverse point we swap the control stack and the back stack

   We will have the following instructions:
         - Switch                                   Reverse point of the program
         -
